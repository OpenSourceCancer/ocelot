OCELOT:

Tool to analyze clinical aspects of the cancer dataset available on line.
the initial implementation take the dataset just from GEO, but the architecture
of the project is thought to be easily extensible to other sources.

This project is based on the Django framework, also a "Front End" (the admin
part will be missing) in PHP4 is in development. 
PHP4 because then is easily usable on Apache based server, 
even in the older installation (yeah PHP5 came out 8 years ago...).
