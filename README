OCELOT:

Tool to gather and analyze clinical aspects of cancer datasets.
The initial implementation take the dataset just from GEO, but the architecture
of the project is thought to be easily extensible to other sources.

This project is based on the Django framework. A "Front End" (the admin
part will be missing) in PHP4 is also in development. 
PHP4 because then is easily usable on Apache based servers, 
even with an outdated configuration (yeah PHP5 came out 8 years ago...).
